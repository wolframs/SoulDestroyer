This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Desktop.

# Soul Destroyer
Name inspired by a popular Solana Trading Bot and the Game "Supreme Commander" with its iconic Soul Ripper unit.

## Should I use this?
No.

## Why does this exist?
Because I cared about SOL trashcoins for two weeks and I wanted to dip my fingers in the related APIs.

Also because Kotlin Multiplatform Compose Apps are now a thing and I felt like designing UI for one.

## What can this do?

Not much. It can:
* Store Wallet info unencrypted in a database on your local disk
* Request Memo and Aidrop Transactions on the Dev-, Test- and MainNet
* Talk to a local Node Server running the Raydium API for demonstration purposes
* Change colours and themes (fancy!)
* Be unclean in many regards
* Show random AI generated images and very clever Tips on its fabulous Home Screen
* Things I may have forgotten since I last worked on this
