This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Desktop.

# Soul Destroyer
Name inspired by a popular Solana Trading Bot and the Game "Supreme Commander" with its iconic Soul Ripper unit.

## Should I use this?
No.

## Why does this exist?
Because I cared about SOL trashcoins for two weeks and I wanted to dip my fingers in the related APIs.

Also because Kotlin Multiplatform Compose Apps are now a thing and I felt like designing UI for one.
